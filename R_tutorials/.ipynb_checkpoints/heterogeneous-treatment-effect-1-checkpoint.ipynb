In other words, for a significance level $\\alpha$, they guarantee that with probability $1 - \\alpha$ we will make zero false discoveries. However, when the number of hypotheses being tested is very large, this criterion may be so stringent that it prevents us from being able to detect real effects. Instead, there exist alternative procedures that control the (asymptotic) **false discovery rate (FDR)**, defined as the expected proportion of true null hypotheses rejected among all hypotheses rejected. One such procedure is the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which is available in base R via `p.adjust(..., method=\"BH\")`. For what remains we'll stick with FWER control, but keep in mind that FDR control can also useful in exploratory analyses or settings in which there's a very large number of hypotheses under consideration.\n",

However, valid tests can also be attained if by **sample splitting**: we can use a subset of the sample to find promising subgroups, then test hypotheses about these subgroups in the remaining sample. This kind of sample splitting for hypothesis testing is called **honesty**.\n",

    "#### Data-driven subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with causal trees, we can use causal forests to divide our observations into subgroups. In place of leaves, we'll rank observation into (say) quintiles according to their estimated CATE prediction; see, e.g., [Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo, Fernández-Val (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04802) for similar ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a subtle but important point that needs to be addressed here. As we have mentioned before, when predicting the conditional average treatment effect $\\htau(X_i)$ for observation $i$ we should in general avoid using a model that was fitted using observation $i$. This sort of sample splitting (which we called **honesty** above) is one of the required ingredients to get unbiased estimates of the CATE using the methods described here. However, when ranking estimates of two observations $i$ and $j$, we need something a little stronger: we must ensure that the model was not fit using _either_ $i$ _or_ $j$'s data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way of overcoming this obstacle is simple. First, divide the data into $K$ folds (subsets). Then, cycle through the folds, fitting a CATE model on $K-1$ folds. Next, for each held-out fold, _separately_ rank the unseen observations into $Q$ groups based on their prediction  (i.e., if $Q=5$, then we rank observations by estimated CATE into \"top quintile\", \"second quintile\", and so on). After concatenating the independent rankings together, we can study the differences in observations in each rank-group. \n",
    "\n",
    "[This gist](https://gist.github.com/halflearned/bea4e5137c0c81fd18a75f682da466c8) computes the above for `grf`, and it should not be hard to modify it so as to replace forests by any other non-parametric method. However, for `grf` specifically, there's a small trick that allows us to obtain a valid ranking: we can pass a vector of fold indices to the argument `clusters` and rank observations within each fold. This works because estimates for each fold (\"cluster\")   trees are computed using trees that were not fit using observations from that fold. Here's how to do it. "
